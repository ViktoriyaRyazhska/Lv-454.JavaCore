Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading,
both are used to achieve multitasking. However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads
use a shared memory area.They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching
between the threads takes less time than process. Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.
The var keyword can be used in place of a type when declaring a variable.
This feature can be used to shorten variable declarations, especially when instantiating generic types,
and is even necessary with LINQ expressions (since queries may generate very complex types).
